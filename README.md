# Heads-up notifications #
With this app, any device can get the heads-up notifications introduced in Android 5 “Lollipop”, no root required. And the popups actually look like those in Android Lollipop.
But according to Addictivetips (and a lot of the users), this app “has done more than just replicate a feature of Lollipop. Even if you aren’t dying to try Lollipop and some of its new features, this app is worth a try“.

<div style="width: 500px; padding: 10px; background-color: #ffffb6; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
<p>As you might have noticed, I don’t really have time to work on Heads-up anymore. Heads-up will keep working, but I won’t add any new features. Maybe someday in the future, but right now I’ve got too much other exciting stuff going on :)</p>
<p><b>I’d like to say thank you for using Heads-up, leaving over 30,000 awesome reviews on Google Play, sending me thousands of emails with feedback, and translating it into 30 languages. And of course a huge thank you to those who donated as well!</b></p>
<p>Seems like you’ve been busy telling your friends about Heads-up too, we’ve been getting over 1,000 new users <b>daily</b> for a total of almost <b>900,000 downloads</b>!</p>
<p>I’d never be able to pull this off without you!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Simen</p>

## Common issues ##
#### If no popups appear: ####
*The universal problemsolver list*
- Did you remember to enable the service by pressing the "Enable/disable" button and then setting Heads-up to ON in the next screen?
- Make sure the service actually is running. Does it show up under System Settings > Apps > Running?
- If not, reboot the phone. Does that help?
- [4.2 and earlier] Do you have any other accessibility services running? Some other services, like Pushbullet, blocks Heads-up from reading notifications.
- Uninstall the app completely, reboot the phone, and install it again. Make sure you are using the [latest version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=codes.simen.l50notifications). After enabling the service inside the app, reboot the phone.
- Allow more priority levels in the settings.
- Some phones block Heads-up from displaying popups. Check that "draw on top" or "display popups" is enabled in System Settings > Apps > Heads-up.

#### XIAOMI, ZTE and MIUI users: ####
Before you can use this app, you'll probably need to give it some slack when it comes to security.

1. Go to System Settings > All > Apps > Downloaded > Heads-up notifications.
2. Toggle the switch that says 'Show popup windows' (second option).
3. At the bottom, go to 'Manage permissions'.
4. Set 'I trust this app' to on.

*It might also be necessary to reset the app data/settings.*

#### Huawei users: ####
*While I don't have any Huawei devices to test this with, a user said the following works on Huawei Ascend P7:*

Open the app 'phone manager', click settings in the top right corner. Select "dropzone management" and give the app permission.

If this doesn't work, try the instructions for XIAOMI/ZTE/MIUI users.

#### Lollipop users: ####
A fix for the "Don't disturb" and "Block current app" features is on its way.

#### Device talking? ####
This is a bug in Samsung's firmware. See post on my [website](http://simen.codes/stuff/samsung-phone-talking/). If you don't need Text-To-Speech, you can also go to System Settings > Apps > All, and disable everything with TTS or Text-To-Speech in the name.

#### Uninstalling: ####
If you find that the uninstall button is disabled, go to Settings > Security > Device administrators > Heads-up, and tap Disable.

#### Only one notification ####
Yup, that's right. **Heads-up does only show one notification.** Period. See [issue #34](https://github.com/SimenCodes/heads-up/issues/34).

#### Something else? ####
Something I haven't covered here? I have answered all kinds questions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SimenCodes/heads-up/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
If your question hasn't been answered there *(protip: use the search box)*, you're probably out of luck (I don't provide support for Heads-up anymore, see note at the top of this page).
